Thats all you need to know, see ya! By the way, more instructions will be in the files. Edit them with the help of the tutorial in-file! It can actually help you, like "what does this variable stand for?" or "why is there a import that i've never seen before?". It will answer you by using the comments.

*Okay, now 100%. See ya!*
