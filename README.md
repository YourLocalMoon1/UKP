To clone this project, you simply need to:

### 1'st way

- Download [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
  * 1. Goto into the website
  * 2. Find the cyan monitor
  * 3. SMASH that 8% darker button "Download for {YOUR OS HERE}"
  * 4. When you get redirected, and in the "Standalone Installer" category, click on the "64-bit Git for {YOUR OS HERE} Setup." for 64-bit OS users, and the same for 32-bit OS users, but simply click on the "32-bit Git for {YOUR OS HERE} Setup." button.
  * 5. All you need to do is click on the installer and install it. (everyone knows how to do that, right?) PROFIT! You're done.
- Download [Python](https://www.python.org/)
  * COME ON, I THINK YOU ALREADY KNOW HOW TO DO IT, RIGHT?
- Install the modules
  * 1. Open your terminal
  * 2. Type the following command: `cd {YOUR DIRECTORY HERE}`
  * 3. If you have Python installed, type the following command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`. If you don't, follow the previous step and install it.
  * 4. Wait until the installing finishes, and you're done!
- Open your terminal, and type the following command: `cd {YOUR DIRECTORY HERE}`
- Copy & paste the command in there: `git clone https://github.com/YourLocalMoon1/UKP.git`.

### 2'nd way

- Go to the GitHub page of the project (come on, you're already on it)
- Click on the green "<> Code" button
- Click on the "Download Zip" button
- If you have Windows 10, simply open and extract it. If you don't, install [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) or [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/), and then extract it using one of these tools.
  * Please note that you still have to install the Python modules. Head back to the 1'st way.
- Move the extracted folder anywhere you want, and TADA! You're done.

**Please know that it will create another folder, so if you want to download it into your desktop. just change your directory to Desktop, and it will create a folder in there.**

Thats all you need to know, see ya! By the way, more instructions will be in the files. Edit them with the help of the tutorial in-file! It can actually help you, like "what does this variable stand for?" or "why is there a import that i've never seen before?". It will answer you by using the comments.

*Okay, now 100%. See ya!*
